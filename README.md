# Project-Bankruptcy-Prevention
The project is to create a classification model that predicts the chances of a business facing bankruptcy based on the key feature like Industrial Risk, Management Risk, Financial Flexibility, Credibility, Competitiveness, Operating Risk. 

<h1>Business Objective:<h1>

This is a classification project, since the variable to predict is binary (bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy).
The goal here is to model the probability that a business goes bankrupt from different features.
